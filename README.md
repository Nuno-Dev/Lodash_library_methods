In this small project I recreated some of the famous Lodash.js library's methods

Welcome!

In this small project I recreated 10 methods of the famous Lodash.js library (using JavaScript):
- Clamp()
- inRange()
- words()
- pad()
- has()
- invert()
- findKey()
- drop()
- dropWhile()
- chunk()

Hope you enjoy it!

Best wishes, Nuno Martins
